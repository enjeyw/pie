# Pie NFT

Compute the digits of pi on the Ethereum blockchain and preserve them in an NFT. You get your digits. Some NFTs will contain multiple digits if you spend the gas. Free to mint, and "unlimited" supply.

Though beware, the gas required will go up as we get further into pi. As far as I know, no algorithm can compute a new digit in constant time. At some point, we will hit the gas limit, and no more digits can be minted. Perhaps this contract will be revisited as the limit increases.

WIP. Will post address here when deployed for apes. May not happen.
